# sql-challenge
This work was done for the data visualization bootcamp from edx affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. This repository is for the assignment from Module 9 - SQL.

I first downloaded the starter code for this assignment, found in the folder Starter_Code. There is folder inside called data, containing CSV files of the data used in this assignment. I looked at the CSV files and began to consider the relationships between them.

Next I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) with the help of bootcamp tutor Kourt Bailey in the application QuickDBD. I copied the text that I typed into QuickDBD to create the ERD; it can be found in the file schema.txt. I then exported a picture of the ERD I created in QuickDBD as the file erd.png. Finally, I exported the schemata for PostgreSQL as the file schema.sql. All of these files can be found in the folder EmployeeSQL.

I opened the file schema.sql in PostgreSQL in a database I created called sql-challenge. I annotated the file and then ran it to create the tables for this assignment. Once the tables had been created, I imported the csv files into their corresponding tables in the order they were created.

Next I opened a new query tool and created queries to answer the data analysis questions from this assignment. These queries are saved in the file MHqueries.sql in the EmployeeSQL folder. There were two instances where I could not find the method to retrieve the required data from the bootcamp class sessions and so I searched online for answers to my questions. These instances where I consulted outside sources are marked above the relevant queries with the links commented.
